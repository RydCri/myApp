The underlying architecture is different, such that developers have to write applications using Rust instead of Solidity or Vyper. However, this may soon change with the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi applications on Solana is Serum, built by the team behind FTX.",
